// The Folder, Feed, Story, and StoryCache classes could be quite useful going forward; Rather than calling getStory() to get the dictionary, could have a variation that returns a Story instance. Could fetch from the cache if available, or make and cache one from the dictionary. Would need to remove it from the cache when changing anything about a story. Could perhaps make the cache part of StoriesCollection.
