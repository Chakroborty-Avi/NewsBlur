If you're like me and like to have NewsBlur sitting open all day, then you'll love the new NewsBlur macOS app. It's a first-class app that supports all of NewsBlur's features, from intelligence training to sharing/blurblogs. 

Introducing the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsblur/id463981119">NewsBlur macOS app</a>, available for free on the Mac App Store.

The macOS app also supports all of the themes, so it can turn itself into dark mode automatically.

If you have any ideas you'd like to see on macOS, feel free to post an idea on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur Forum</a>.

Coming up soon are the discover feeds feature, where you can see related feeds based purely on semantic similarity (and not based on mined usage data), as well as real-time updates to the macOS app similar to the dashboard on the web.
