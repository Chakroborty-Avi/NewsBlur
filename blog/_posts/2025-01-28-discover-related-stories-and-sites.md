I want to introduce you to the new Discover Stories and Discover Sites features. Sometimes you're reading a story and you want to know everything there is to know about that topic.

As you can see, this isn't your normal related stories feature. It shows all of the related stories, segmented by the folders that a site is a part of. This folder control allows you to filter down to an individual site and up to every feed you subscribe to when finding related stories.
